abstract = {The goal of semantic segmentation is to segment the input image according to semantic information and predict the semantic category of each pixel from a given label set. With the gradual intellectualization of modern life, more and more applications need to infer relevant semantic information from images for subsequent processing, such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, video surveillance, etc. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technologies of semantic segmentation based on deep learning. Because semantic segmentation requires a large number of pixel-level annotations, in order to reduce the fine-grained requirements of annotation and reduce the economic and time cost of manual annotation, this paper studies the works on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. In order to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the segmentation model, this paper investigates the works on domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. Many types of sensors are usually equipped in some practical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. In order to mine the association between multi-modal data and improve the accuracy of the segmentation model, this paper investigates the works based on multi-modal data fusion semantic segmentation. The real-time performance of the model needs to be considered in practical application. This paper analyzes the key factors affecting the real-time performance of the segmentation model and investigates the works on real-time semantic segmentation. Finally, this paper summarizes the challenges and promising research directions of semantic segmentation tasks based on deep learning.}
