\section{Datasets}\label{sec:data-sets}

Unfortunately, few datasets on chronic wounds are publicly available \cite{Oota_2023_WACV}. They often feature only a specific type of chronic wound, mainly diabetic or pressure ulcer. An example of such a specialised dataset is the data from the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 \cite{DFUC2022}. However, it is only available after application and, therefore, is inappropriate for this project due to its limited timescope. Another data set featuring foot ulcer wounds is publicly available in the Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge 2021 \cite{Wang2020}. It consists of 1010 images, which are augmented to build a data set with a training set of 3645 images and a test set of 405 images. Due to the nature of the challenge, labels for the test set are unavailable.

\paragraph{WSNet data set} The data set mainly used in the scope of this project is the WSNet data set featuring eight different wound types: venous ulcer, trauma wound, diabetic ulcer, surgical wound, arterial ulcer, cellulitis, pressure ulcer and a not further specified group of other wounds \cite{Oota_2023_WACV, Oota_2021_WACV}. In total, it consists of 2686 images and their corresponding masks. With this, it consists of more individual images and wound types than the publicly available data set mentioned above. Unfortunately, the wound classification itself is not available. Furthermore, \citeauthor{Oota_2023_WACV} mention another separate data set for pre-training with wound type classification, which is also not publicly available.
