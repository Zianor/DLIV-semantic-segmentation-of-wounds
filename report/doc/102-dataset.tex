\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Available Datasets}
\begin{itemize}
	\item not many medical datasets on chronic wounds publicly available \cite{Oota_2023_WACV}
	\item often focus on specific type of chronic wounds - often diabetic or pressure ulcer
	\item Example for such a dataset: data from Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 \cite{DFUC2022} $\rightarrow$ unfortunately only available after application, therefore not appropriate for this project with limited timescope
	\item other dataset of Foot ulcer wounds is available as part of the Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge 2021 \cite{Wang2020}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{WSNET Dataset}

\begin{itemize}
	\item used dataset consists of 2686 wound images with their corresponding masks introduced by \citeauthor{Oota_2023_WACV} \cite{Oota_2023_WACV}.
	\item 8 different wound types represented in dataset: venous ulcer, trauma wound, diabetic ulcer, surgical wound, arterial ulcer, cellulitis, pressure ulcer and a not further specified group of other wounds
