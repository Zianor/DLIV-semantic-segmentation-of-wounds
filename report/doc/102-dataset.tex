\section{Dataset}

\begin{itemize}
	\item not many medical datasets on chronic wounds publicly available \cite{Oota_2023_WACV}
	\item often focus on specific type of chronic wounds - TODO: which one was over-represented again?
	\item used dataset consists of 2686 wound images with their corresponding masks introduced by \citeauthor{Oota_2023_WACV} \cite{Oota_2023_WACV}.
	\item 8 different wound types represented in dataset: venous ulcer, trauma wound, diabetic ulcer, surgical wound, arterial ulcer, cellulitis, pressure ulcer and a not further specified group of other wounds
	\item unfortunately, the wound classification is not available
\end{itemize}
