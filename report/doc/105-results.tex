\section{Results and Evaluation}

\subsection{Re-implementation and evaluation of WSNet}

\begin{itemize}
	\item contribution: reimplementation of a framework in a better documented way, making the reconstruction of results easier
	\item documentation of this implementation
	\item identified discrepances between paper and available code
	\item comparison of results
	\item showed that reported "good" architecture does not yield significant performance increasements
	\item why: models already capture localized information, this is why those are sota segmenatation frameworks, further localisation does not really make sense, maybe rather change parameters of used models to improve results
	\item Which architecture is suited best for wound segmentation? Why and what other alternatives would there be?
\end{itemize}
