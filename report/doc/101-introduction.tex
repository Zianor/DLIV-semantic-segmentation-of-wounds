\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item many people affected by chronic wounds that need to be monitored
	\item Why is automatic Wound Segmentation so important? And why is it a complex problem?
	\item Manual segmentation by experts expensive and very time consuming
	\item experts differ in their segmentation
	\item different types of wounds have different characteristics
	\item changing lighting conditions, distance to camera, camera angle, different cameras have impact on result
	\item controlled environment not feasible in clinical setting
	\item ideally, we want to be able to take pictures with a smartphone without overly complicated instructions for the person taking the picture
	\item experience as photographer should not be required, clinical proffessionals should be able to take pictures that are then segmented correctly
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item can the results be reproduced?
	\item what influence does the input image size have? Can we rescale the images and are able to transfer what is learned
	\item how robust is the model/architectures to transformations/distortions on the input
	\item XAI
\end{itemize}
